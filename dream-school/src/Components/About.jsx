                                        Convent School has been playing a crucial role in making the school an abode where the child can enjoy the facets of life and rhythm of living .Through all our activities, we aim at inspiring the child to assimilate constructive thinking so that vivacity and virtue co-exist in the storehouse of the mind of the child and hence build up a good personality. Academic excellence is not the only criterion of true education but development of a disciplined body and mind towards “serve the humanity” (our school motto) is what that is nurtured in this institution. The child is stimulated to develop curiosity and interest which in turn lead him towards experimentation, creativity and innovation. More than just acquiring knowledge the child must grow in manifestation of wisdom
